# Dockerfiles for the Hub

Currently a synthesized version of the official Apache & PHP5 Dockerfiles.

Build time is roughly ** 8 minutes** on my MacBook Pro.

## Referenced Dockerfiles

* Apache 2.4 Dockerfile (https://github.com/docker-library/httpd/blob/master/2.4/Dockerfile)
* PHP 5.6 Dockerfile (https://github.com/docker-library/php/blob/master/5.6/apache/Dockerfile)

## Current Status

* Apache 2.5 & PHP 5.6 are currently building from source.  However, they are not configured correctly.
